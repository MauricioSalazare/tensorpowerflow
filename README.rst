TensorPowerFlow
===============


What is TensorPowerFlow
-----------------------

An ultra-fast power flow based on Laurent series expansion. The power flow is intended for a applications where massive
amounts of power flows computations are required. e.g., electrical load time series, metaheuristics, electrical grid
environments for reinforcement learning.

How to install
--------------
The package can be installed via pip using:

.. code:: shell

    pip install tensorpowerflow
